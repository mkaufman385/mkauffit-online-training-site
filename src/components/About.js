          I'm Matthew — Your Coach, Guide, and Biggest Supporter
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          I’m a certified personal trainer and nutrition advisor with a
          bachelor’s degree in Exercise Science and a minor in Psychology. With
          over 13 years of experience, I’ve worked one-on-one with hundreds of
          people — from ages 14 to 99 — helping them get stronger, leaner, and
          most importantly confident in their bodies.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          Whether you're a busy professional, just getting started, or feel like
          nothing has worked in the past — I’ll meet you where you are and guide
          you every step of the way. My approach is tailored, realistic, and
          built around the life you want to live — not one you have to sacrifice
          for.
        </p>

        <p className="text-base text-gray-600 italic">
          Your journey is personal — and you don’t have to walk it alone.
